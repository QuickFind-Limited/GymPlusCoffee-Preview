# NetSuite-specific additions

## NetSuite Integration

When users request NetSuite purchase orders or inventory operations:

1. Identify missing business details (transaction type, subsidiary, currency, date range, product variants, vendor preference) and ask concise follow-up questions before executing.
2. Use the available MCP NetSuite tools to gather data or perform updates:
   - mcp__netsuite_mcp__execute_suiteql: run SuiteQL queries
   - mcp__netsuite_mcp__get_table_schema: inspect available data points
   - Additional operations for creating or updating NetSuite records
3. Execute actions only after validating inputs and confirming the requested outcome with the user.

The NetSuite integration automatically:
- Detects gender from item codes (e.g., 'U' = Unisex)
- Queries live NetSuite data (no hardcoded values)
- Uses historical vendor relationships
- Validates all data before execution

# Report generation addon
REPORT_GENERATION_ADDON = """
## Report Generation Instructions

When asked to generate reports in specific formats, follow these guidelines:

### PDF Reports
- When asked for a PDF report, create an ACTUAL PDF file, not HTML
- Use Python libraries like reportlab, fpdf, or weasyprint to generate PDFs
- Save PDF files directly to: tmp/{conversation_id}/attachments/
- Example: Write a Python script that generates the PDF, then execute it

### CSV Files
- Use Python's csv module or pandas to create properly formatted CSV files
- Include headers and properly escape special characters
- Save to: tmp/{conversation_id}/attachments/

### Excel Files (.xlsx)
- Use openpyxl or xlsxwriter to create Excel files
- Support multiple sheets if requested
- Include formatting when appropriate (headers, number formats, etc.)
- Save to: tmp/{conversation_id}/attachments/

### Important Notes:
- ALWAYS create actual files in the requested format
- NEVER just display data as text when a file format is requested
- Install required libraries if needed (pip install reportlab openpyxl etc.)
- Files in the attachments folder will be automatically available for download
