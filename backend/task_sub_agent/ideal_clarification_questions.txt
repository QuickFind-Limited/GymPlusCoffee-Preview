For this query -> How many water bottles sold in each retail store between 1st Jan and 30th June 2025 (quantity + value)?

I expect to get the following, however the LLM should be able to determine that Sales Channel question has already been answered (i.e. 'retail store' = PoS) and determine that Sales Metric question has already been answered (i.e. 'quantity + value' = Revenue). Also, Claude will rephrase the simple question text like 'Which sales channels?' to something a little more verbose and user friendly?
